This part of the site documents the goals, organization, and methods of the SQ5 Fan Dub project.

## Goal

The goal of the project is to create a distributable package that will add voice-acted lines to Space Quest 5, patching an existing distribution of the Space Quest 5 game.

Targetted Platforms:

- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux

Targeted Releases:

- [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/en/game/space_quest_4_5_6)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/10110/Space_Quest_Collection/)

Each platform will have a separate distribution, although they will all use the same core implementation of the patch to run.

## Implementation

There two layers of implementation for this project: The modifications needed to be applied to the core game needed to implement voices, and the way that these modifications are applied to the released distribution to be run by the player.

## Progress

We measure progress on a milestone-by-milestone basis. We do not create official deadlines for any but the next milestone in the list, but always hope to have at least two milestones described to give us a general guideline of what we have yet to do.

Milestones will be documented on a separate page.
